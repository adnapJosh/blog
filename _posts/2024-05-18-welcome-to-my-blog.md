Hello my name is Josh, and here I'll be posting update on the various projects and homelab technologies I'm working with.
This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] with a fork of a [Jekyll][jekyll] theme as the main html coding.

Currently my Server Setup is a:
Proxmox machine using a Ryzen 5 2600x, Nvidia GEFORCE GTX 960, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SATA SSD, 1TB SATA HDD
Main computer/LLama3 host with a Ryzen 5 5600x, Radeon RX 6600XT, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB NVME SSD

Current Services:
PiHole DNS
DuckDNS
Portainer
GNS3
Wireguard
Dashy

Current Networking Hardware:
TP-Link tl-sg105e 1GB 5 port managed switch
TP-Link POE injector
TP-Link EAP223
APC UPS BE550G
Navepoint 12U rack

Future Plans
 Organize my current homelab setup better
 Set up a dashboard (Dashy?) for quick access all my services (5/12/24)
 Learn more about Ansible and Terraform and see if deploying them would be useful
 Learn YAML
 Ollama seems interesting, but I'm unsure if I could reasonably run it 24/7 with my current resources
 Get a larger (> 8 port) POE+ switch
 Potentially move away from decentralized security and utilize a self-hosted NVR
 Create a NAS machine(s)
 Locally create SSL certificates for my services
